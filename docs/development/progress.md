# Forge Progress

Persistent record of completed milestones/phases, per `docs/development/roadmap.md`.

## Phase 1 — Core Foundations

### M1 — Tensor abstraction and CPU execution boundary
`Tensor` (shape/dtype/device), `DType`, `Device`, the `Backend`/`CPUBackend` dispatch boundary, and
Forge-specific errors (`ShapeMismatchError`, `UnsupportedDTypeError`, `UnsupportedDeviceError`).
Operations: `+`, `-`, `*` (broadcasting), `@` (1D/2D matmul), `.sum()`, `.reshape()`. 53 tests.

### M2 — Automatic differentiation core
Reverse-mode autograd on top of the M1 Tensor: `requires_grad`, `.grad`, `.is_leaf`, `.grad_fn`,
`.backward()`, `.zero_grad()`. New `forge/autograd/` package (`Node` graph nodes, topological
`run_backward`, broadcast/matmul/sum backward math). Backward rules for all M1 operations, with
broadcast-aware gradient reduction, gradient accumulation across multiple use sites, and
non-scalar-output backward requiring an explicit upstream gradient. New `GradientStateError`.
Graph is freed as it is consumed by `backward()`; a second `backward()` call on the same non-leaf
output raises rather than silently reusing freed state. 90 tests total (53 M1 + 37 M2). See
`docs/architecture/autograd.md`.
